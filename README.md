# fix-simple-binary-encoding
This project contains specifications and resources for Simple Binary Encoding (SBE).
SBE is a FIX standard for binary message encoding. 

For a fuller explanation, see [FIX Simple Binary Encoding](http://fixtradingcommunity.github.io/fix-simple-binary-encoding/).

## Protocol stack
SBE is part of a family of protocols created by the High Performance Working Group
 of the FIX Trading Community. SBE is a presentation layer protocol (layer 6).

## Versions
### Current approved version: 1.0 Release Candidate 3
Version 1.0 RC3 was approved by the Global Technical Committee in December 2014. The
RC3 specification is included here for reference only. Pull requests for this
version will not be accepted.

### Next working draft: 1.0 Release Candidate 4
A baseline for version 1.0 RC4 will be posted here soon. The
working group encourages users to submit issues for error corrections
and enhancements. The working group will consider pull requests for
changes to the working draft.

### Previous versions
