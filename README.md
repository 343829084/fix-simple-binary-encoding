# fix-simple-binary-encoding
This project contains specifications and resources for Simple Binary Encoding (SBE).
SBE is a FIX standard for binary message encoding. 

For a fuller explanation, see [FIX Simple Binary Encoding](http://fixtradingcommunity.github.io/fix-simple-binary-encoding/).

## Protocol stack
SBE is part of a family of protocols created by the High Performance Working Group
 of the FIX Trading Community. SBE is a presentation layer protocol (layer 6).

## Versions

### Planned Lifecycle

The planned lifecycle of this project is to roll out new features in a series of release candidates. After each release candidate is approved, it will be exposed to public review. Issues may be entered here in GitHub or in a discussion forum on the FIX Trading Community site. When a version is considered complete, the last release candidate will be promoted to Draft Standard. Following further public review, a Draft Standard may be promoted to the final specification for that version. Only minor errata are permitted. To reach the final stage, the Draft Standard must be reviewed for no less than 6 months, and at least two interoperable implementations must be certified. That version is henceforth immutable.

### Current approved version: 1.0 Draft Standard
Version 1.0 RC4 was promoted to SBE version 1.0 Draft Standard by the Global Technical Committee in June 2016. The next steps are certification of at least two interopable implementations and final approval by the GTC.

The Draft Standard specification is available on the [FIX Trading Community site](http://www.fixtradingcommunity.org/pg/structure/tech-specs/simple-binary-encoding).

### Working version: 2.0 Release Candidate 1

The working group will consider issues and pull requests for the next release candidate. The planned themes for Version 2.0 Release Candidate 1 are:
* Further enhancements to the schema extension mechanism
* Improvement of the XML schema

### Conformance test suite
The [SBE Conformance project](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-sbe-conformance) provides a conformance test suite to verify interoperability of SBE implementations. All implementors are invited to demonstrate their conformance to the standard.

### XML namespace
The XML namespace for SBE version 1.0 message schemas is [http://fixprotocol.io/2016/sbe](http://fixprotocol.io/2016/sbe).
